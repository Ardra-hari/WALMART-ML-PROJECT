1.Problem Statement:
  A retail store that has multiple outlets across the country are facing issues in managing the inventory - to match the demand with respect to supply.
  1. You are provided with the weekly sales data for their various outlets. Use statistical analysis, EDA, outlier analysis, and handle the missing values to come up with various insights that can give them a clear
  perspective on the following:
  a. If the weekly sales are affected by the unemployment rate, if yes - which stores are suffering the most?
  b. If the weekly sales show a seasonal trend, when and what could be the reason?
  c. Does temperature affect the weekly sales in any manner?
  d. How is the Consumer Price index affecting the weekly sales of various stores?
  e. Top performing stores according to the historical data.
  f. The worst performing store, and how significant is the difference between the highest and lowest performing stores.
  2. Use predictive modeling techniques to forecast the sales for each store for the next 12 weeks.

2. Project Objective:
  The objective of the Walmart project is to analyze the weekly sales data of multiple Walmart stores across the country and provide insights to address the following questions:
  • Determine if the weekly sales are affected by various factors like Unemployment rate,Seasonality,Temperature and Consumer Price Index (CPI)
  • Identify top performing stores based on historical data.
  • Identify the worst performing store and analyze the significance of the difference between the highest and lowest performing stores.
  • Utilize predictive modeling techniques to forecast sales for each store for the next 12 weeks.
  By achieving these objectives, the retail store can gain valuable insights into their sales patterns, factors influencing sales, and make informed decisions regarding inventory management, staffing, and other
  operational aspects to improve overall performance and efficiency.The dataset walmart.csv contains 6435 rows and 8 columns.

3. Data Pre-processing Steps and Inspiration:
  The preprocessing of the data included the following steps:
  1.Checking for null values: - To improve accuracy by replacing/removing null values.
  2.Checking for duplicate values: - To improve accuracy by deleting duplicate values.
  3. Outlier Analysis: - Conduct outlier analysis for numerical features like weekly sales, temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment rate and decide whether to remove outliers, transform them, or keep them
  based on their impact on the analysis and modeling.
  4. Data Visualization: - Visualize the distributions of numerical features, correlations between features, and trends over time using plots like histograms, scatter plots, line plots, and heatmaps.
  Explore relationships between features and the target variable (weekly sales) through visualizations to gain insights.
  Inspiration:
  The inspiration for the project stem from several perspectives, all aimed at addressing real-world challenges faced by retail businesses like Walmart. Overall, the inspiration for this project lies in the
  potential to extract actionable insights from retail sales data, empowering businesses to make informed decisions, adapt to market dynamics, and thrive in a competitive landscape.

4. Choosing the Algorithm for the Project:
  Time Series Forecasting:
  I have chosen Facebook Prophet library for forecasting since it is an open source forecasting tool developed by Facebook and here we don’t need to make the data stationary. It is designed for creating accurate
  time series forecast. Since Walmart data typically involves time-series data (e.g., daily or weekly sales), algorithms specialized in time series forecasting are suitable. Facebook Prophet is a best choice for
  this task. It handles trends and seasonality effects automatically, making it suitable for modeling weekly sales over time. It can be used to forecast the number of weekly sales expected in the future based on
  historical data.

5. Assumptions:
  1. Independence of Observations:
  We assume that observations in the time series data are independent of each other. This assumption allows us to use standard statistical methods for analysis and modeling. However, in reality, there may be
  dependencies or autocorrelation between successive observations, which may need to be addressed using time series modeling techniques.
  3. Forecasting Accuracy:
  We assume that the accuracy of sales forecasts generated by the predictive modeling techniques, such as Prophet, is sufficient for practical decision-making purposes. While the forecasts aim to capture
  underlying trends and patterns in the data, there may be uncertainty associated with the predictions, which stakeholders should consider when making decisions.
  5. External Factors:
  We assume that the factors influencing sales, such as temperature, holidays, fuel prices, CPI, and unemployment rate, adequately capture the external environment's impact on sales. However, there may be other
  unobserved or unknown factors that could also influence sales but are not included in the analysis.

6. Model Evaluation and Techniques:
  When evaluating the model we typically follow these steps:
  •Preparation of Training data : Prepare the historical time series data, ensuring it has a suitable format with a datetime column and the target variable we want to forecast.
  •Model Initialization: Initialize a Prophet model object and optionally set any relevant parameters like seasonality, holidays, and growth.
  •Fit the Model: Fit the Prophet model to your training data using the fit method.
  •Forecast Generation: Generate forecasts using the trained model. We can specify the number of periods in future that we want to forecast using make_future_dataframe() method and then make predictions using the predict method.
  •Visual Evaluation: Plot the actual values against the predicted values to visually inspect how well the model performs on the training data.

7. Inferences:
  1 . Impact of External Factors:
  The analysis revealed that external factors such as temperature, holidays, fuel prices, consumer price index (CPI), and unemployment rate significantly influence weekly sales.
  Higher temperatures tend to correlate with increased sales, suggesting that warmer weather may lead to higher consumer demand for certain products.
  Holidays, especially major ones like Christmas and Thanksgiving, result in spikes in sales, indicating seasonal effects on consumer behaviour.
  2 . Store-Level Performance:
  Through historical sales data analysis, top-performing stores were identified based on their consistent high sales volumes.
  Store-specific factors such as location, demographics, and local economic conditions likely contribute to differences in sales performance across stores.

8. Future Possibilities of the Project
  1. Advanced Predictive Modeling Techniques:
  Explore advanced machine learning algorithms beyond Prophet, such as deep learning models (e.g., LSTM networks) or ensemble methods, to capture complex relationships and nonlinear patterns in the data.
  Experiment with hybrid forecasting approaches that combine statistical methods with machine learning techniques for improved forecast accuracy.
  2. Real-Time Forecasting:
  Develop capabilities for real-time or near-real-time sales forecasting to enable Walmart to respond quickly to changing market conditions, demand fluctuations, and external events.
  3. Incorporation of Additional Data:
  Integrate additional external data sources such as demographic data, competitor information, or social media sentiment analysis to enrich the forecasting model and capture additional factors influencing sales.
  Incorporate data from other Walmart business units, such as online sales or store foot traffic, to create a more comprehensive sales forecasting framework.

9. Conclusion:
  In conclusion, the sales forecasting project undertaken for Walmart provides valuable insights into the factors influencing weekly sales at their various stores across the country. Through a combination of
  exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, predictive modeling using the Prophet algorithm, and model evaluation techniques, we have gained a deeper understanding of sales trends, seasonality, and the
  impact of external factors such as unemployment rate, temperature, and consumer price index. Overall, the sales forecasting project equips Walmart with actionable insights to optimize inventory management,
  marketing strategies, and resource allocation, ultimately enabling the company to enhance customer satisfaction, drive business growth, and maintain its competitive edge in the retail industry. By leveraging
  data-driven approaches and continuous improvement efforts, Walmart can adapt to evolving market dynamics and position itself for long-term success.
